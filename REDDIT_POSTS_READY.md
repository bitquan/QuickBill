## üéØ POST #1: r/SideProject (Start Here - Most Welcoming)

**Title:** I built QuickBill - Simple invoice generator for freelancers (React + Firebase + Stripe)

**Post:**

```
Hey r/SideProject!

Just launched my side project - QuickBill, a dead-simple invoice generator for freelancers and small businesses.

üéØ **The Problem I Solved:**
As a freelancer, I was tired of:
- Overly complex invoice software
- High monthly fees for basic features
- Generic templates that didn't fit my work

‚ö° **What I Built:**
- Clean, fast invoice creation (under 2 minutes)
- 10+ industry templates (electrician, designer, photographer, etc.)
- Email invoices directly to clients
- Professional PDF generation
- Mobile-friendly design
- Simple pricing: 3 free invoices, then $4.99/month

üõ†Ô∏è **Tech Stack:**
- React + TypeScript + Vite
- Firebase Auth + Firestore
- Stripe payments
- EmailJS for sending
- Custom PDF generation

üîó **Try it:** https://quickbill-app-b2467.web.app

**Feedback super welcome!** What would you want in an invoice tool?

Planning to open-source parts of the PDF generation logic soon - it was the trickiest part to get right.

## üéØ POST #2: r/freelance (Core Audience)

**Title:** Finally built an invoice tool that doesn't suck - thoughts from fellow freelancers?

**Post:**

```
Fellow freelancers!

After 5+ years of juggling different invoice tools, I got fed up and built my own: QuickBill.

**What drove me crazy about existing tools:**
- $30+ monthly fees for basic invoicing
- Bloated interfaces with features I'll never use
- Templates that look like they're from 2010
- Mobile apps that barely work

**What I built instead:**
‚úÖ Industry-specific templates (finally, invoices that fit your work!)
‚úÖ Email invoices directly to clients
‚úÖ Works perfectly on mobile
‚úÖ Clean, fast interface
‚úÖ Honest pricing: 3 free invoices to try, $4.99/month for unlimited

**Best part:** You can create and send a professional invoice in under 2 minutes.

Try it: https://quickbill-app-b2467.web.app

**Question for the community:** What's your biggest pain point with invoicing? Always looking to improve!

(And yes, it handles taxes, discounts, recurring clients, etc. - all the basics you actually need)

## üéØ POST #3: r/Entrepreneur (Bigger Audience)

**Title:** From frustration to launch: Built QuickBill after seeing the invoicing software gap

**Post:**

```
Hey r/Entrepreneur!

**The backstory:**
Started freelancing in 2020, tried every invoice tool out there. They were either:
- Too expensive for a starting freelancer ($50+ monthly)
- Too complex (CRM features I didn't need)
- Too basic (looked unprofessional)

**The "aha" moment:**
Realized most freelancers just need:
1. Professional-looking invoices
2. Industry-appropriate templates
3. Easy client communication
4. Simple payment tracking

**What I built:**
QuickBill - focused on doing one thing really well: invoicing.

**Key features:**
- 10+ industry templates (electrician, photographer, consultant, etc.)
- Email integration (send directly from the app)
- Mobile-first design
- Clean PDF generation
- Freemium model: 3 free invoices, then $4.99/month

**Tech stack:** React + Firebase + Stripe (keeping it simple)

**The results so far:**
- Built in 3 months
- Launched this week
- First paying customers already!

**Try it:** https://quickbill-app-b2467.web.app

**Question:** What other "simple tools" do you wish existed for small businesses?

Always happy to share technical details or business insights!

## üéØ POST #4: r/webdev (Technical Audience)

**Title:** Built an invoice SaaS with React + Firebase - sharing some technical insights

**Post:**

```
Hey r/webdev!

Just shipped QuickBill (invoice generator) and wanted to share some technical challenges and solutions that might help others:

**Tech Stack:**
- React + TypeScript + Vite
- Firebase Auth + Firestore
- Stripe Connect for payments
- EmailJS for client-side email sending
- Custom PDF generation pipeline

**Interesting technical challenges:**

1. **PDF Generation:**
   - Started with jsPDF - too limited for complex layouts
   - Tried Puppeteer - overkill and server costs
   - Final solution: HTML-to-canvas-to-PDF for perfect styling control

2. **Freemium Architecture:**
   - Free tier: LocalStorage + IndexedDB
   - Pro tier: Automatic cloud migration to Firestore
   - Challenge: Seamless data sync without conflicts

3. **Email Integration:**
   - Wanted to avoid backend complexity
   - EmailJS lets you send emails entirely client-side
   - Great for MVP, planning backend for scale

4. **Template System:**
   - Dynamic form generation based on industry type
   - JSON-driven template configs
   - Each template has different fields/calculations

**Performance wins:**
- Vite for lightning-fast dev builds
- Code splitting by route
- Optimistic UI updates
- Debounced auto-save

**Try the live app:** https://quickbill-app-b2467.web.app

**Questions I'd love input on:**
- Best practices for PDF generation in React?
- Experiences with EmailJS at scale?
- Firebase vs. Supabase for this use case?

Happy to dive deeper into any technical aspects!
```
