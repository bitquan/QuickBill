## üîß Technical Notes

### Database Schema Extensions

```typescript
// Extended BusinessInfo interface
interface BusinessInfo {
  name: string;
  email: string;
  address: string;
  phone: string;
  logo?: string; // Base64 encoded image
}

// New Agreement interface
interface Agreement {
  id: string;
  title: string;
  content: string;
  clientName: string;
  clientEmail: string;
  businessName: string;
  createdAt: string;
  signedAt?: string;
  clientSignature?: string;
  status: "draft" | "sent" | "signed" | "expired";
  expiresAt: string;
  relatedInvoiceId?: string;
}
```

### Performance Considerations

- Logo images stored as Base64 (consider cloud storage for production)
- Payment links generated server-side for security
- Agreement content templates cached for performance

### Security Features

- Payment links are secure Stripe-hosted pages
- Agreement signing includes IP and timestamp logging
- Electronic signatures follow digital signature standards
