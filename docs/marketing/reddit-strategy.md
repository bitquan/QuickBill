## üìù Reddit Post Templates

### **Template 1: "Show & Tell" Post**

**Title:** "Built QuickBill - A simple invoice generator for freelancers (React/Firebase/Stripe)"

**Post:**

```
Hey r/[subreddit]!

I just launched QuickBill - a dead-simple invoice generator that I built for freelancers and small businesses.

üéØ **The Problem:** Creating professional invoices was always a pain. Existing tools were either too complex or too expensive for small freelancers.

‚ö° **The Solution:**
- Clean, simple interface
- 10+ industry-specific templates (electrician, plumber, designer, etc.)
- Email invoices directly to clients
- Professional PDF generation
- $9.99/month for unlimited (3 free to start)

üõ†Ô∏è **Tech Stack:** React + TypeScript, Firebase, Stripe payments, EmailJS

üîó **Try it:** https://quickbill-app-b2467.web.app

**Feedback welcome!** What features would you want in an invoice tool?

### **Template 2: "Pain Point" Post**

**Title:** "Tired of complicated invoice software - built my own simple solution"

**Post:**

```
After years of struggling with bloated invoice software, I decided to build something simple.

**What frustrated me:**
- Monthly fees for basic features
- Complicated interfaces
- Generic templates that don't fit my industry

**What I built:**
QuickBill - just the essentials:
‚úÖ Professional templates for different industries
‚úÖ Send invoices via email
‚úÖ 3 free invoices to try, then $9.99/month
‚úÖ Works perfectly on mobile

**Best part:** You can create and send an invoice in under 2 minutes.

Would love feedback from fellow [freelancers/contractors/etc.]!

### **Template 3: "Technical" Post (for dev subreddits)**

**Title:** "Open sourcing my approach to React invoice generation with PDF export"

**Post:**

```
Built an invoice generator and wanted to share some technical insights:

**Tech Stack:**
- React + TypeScript + Vite
- Firebase Auth + Firestore
- Stripe for payments
- EmailJS for client-side email sending
- Custom PDF generation pipeline

**Interesting challenges:**
1. **PDF Generation:** Used HTML-to-canvas-to-PDF for perfect styling control
2. **Freemium Logic:** Local storage for free tier, cloud sync for paid
3. **Email Integration:** Client-side email without backend complexity
4. **Industry Templates:** Dynamic form generation based on business type

**Live demo:** https://quickbill-app-b2467.web.app

Happy to answer technical questions! The PDF generation approach might be useful for other projects.
